# faustlsp

A LSP Server for the Faust programming language.

# Installation

To install, run  
```sh
go get github.com/carn181/faustlsp@latest
```

This will install a `faustlsp` executable in `$HOME/go/bin` by default.  


Alternatively, you can clone this repository, build and install faustlsp.  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/carn181/faustlsp
cd faustlsp
go build
go install
```

For code formatting, install [faustfmt](https://github.com/carn181/faustfmt) following install instructions in the project's README.

# Usage

## VS Code

[vscode-faust](https://github.com/carn181/vscode-faust) is a VS Code extension for Faust that works with faustlsp. Follow installation steps in the README.md

## Neovim

Sample nvim-lspconfig configuration which requires a .faustcfg.json in the faust project root directory:
```lua
vim.lsp.config('faustlsp', {
    cmd = { 'faustlsp' },
    filetypes = {'faust'},
	workspace_required = true,
	root_markers = { '.faustcfg.json' }
})
```

## Emacs

Sample lsp-mode server config
```lisp
(lsp-register-client
   (make-lsp-client
    :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection "faustlsp")
    :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on "faust")
    :server-id 'faustlsp
    ))
```

# Configuration

You can configure the LSP server and it give it information about the project using a `.faustcfg.json` file defined in a project's root directory.
